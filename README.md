Sync todos among Telekasten, Mac Reminders and iPhone Reminders


I use Mac book pro and iPhone, normally the todos in Reminders are synced between Mac/iPhone by iCloud already, so I could check my todos time by time anywhere.

However, I also create todos in Telekasten notes, such like take some notes, think something need to do, then I create Todo in Telekasten notes directly.

I wrote this script to sync todos between Telekasten and Mac Reminders bidirectionally.
